# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End


## Description
My motivation for this project was to build the back end for an e-commerce site using Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. I built this project for a manager at an internet retail company who wanted a back end for their e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies. Express.js and Sequelize allowed me to build API routes to perfrom RESTful CRUD operations to a database. This project taught me that Express.js and Sequelize is useful in making complex queries to a SQL database with JavaScript instead of SQL syntax.
